# TwitterWeather

Twitter Weather collects data from the API [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and displays the Date on the x Axis, and the temprature on the y Axis

As this was built with the free version of [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) in mind, This program is run every day until we have 10 entrys, With this in mind, this project is about past data, rather than future date, Although the code could be easily alterd to support future data.

An example of the output is as follows - ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/VgNYqwG.png)

Note that the data in this image was manually added to the WeatherData.json file and not representative of the actual conditions of those dates, This is purely illustrative of the final result
